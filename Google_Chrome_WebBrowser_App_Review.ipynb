But, lately, whenever I attempt at opening Chrome, it's a blank screen for several minutes, and once it does finally load, I can't search up anything. All of my other apps work smoothly, my internet connection is fine. Please fix this.

There are different webpages it opens to. I close out the pages and then close the app but it continues to do it.... Alot!! I've tried clearing the cash and whatever else.

It makes it harder to switch between open screens and find the one im looking for. I end up just using multiple windows like before..

The only issue I have with chrome is with the password manager - when it tells you that there's a breach. So, you change the password quickly on the account with the breech but it still shows as a breach and if you've used that password for others, it will show breeches in all those other sites even though there isn't.

It makes it harder to switch between open screens and find the one im looking for. I end up just using multiple windows like before..

So, you change the password quickly on the account with the breech but it still shows as a breach and if you've used that password for others, it will show breeches in all those other sites even though there isn't.

It makes it harder to switch between open screens and find the one im looking for. I end up just using multiple windows like before..

So, you change the password quickly on the account with the breech but it still shows as a breach and if you've used that password for others, it will show breeches in all those other sites even though there isn't.
